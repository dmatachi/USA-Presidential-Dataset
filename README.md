A dataset showing past USA Presidents and their vice.
Data was cleaned and transformed. I removed unnecessary space and made the name case the same all through.

The President and Vice President column was trimmed. The proper function was used to transform the names to enable easy understanding.
Comparing the two Excel sheets, the cleaned data is more understandable than the raw data.
